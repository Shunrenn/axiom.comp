Axiom Corporation — Employee Conduct & Access Rules

Welcome to Axiom Corporation. All personnel, contractors, and guests are expected to follow these rules while on company property or using company systems.

Authorized Access Only
Access to internal systems and portals is limited to authorized personnel. Credentials are personal and non-transferable.

Responsible Use of Resources
Company devices, networks, and services must be used for legitimate business purposes. Avoid actions that may degrade or expose company systems.

Data Protection
Confidential information must be protected at all times. Do not copy, transmit, or distribute sensitive data without explicit authorization.

Reporting Incidents
If you discover a security issue, data leak, or suspicious activity, report it immediately to Security Operations via the official channel.

No Unauthorized Discovery
Probing, scanning, or attempting to discover hidden resources on company servers is prohibited unless you are explicitly authorized to perform security testing.

Contract Terms — CONFIDENTAL
The full Contract Terms are restricted and intended for internal review only. Employees must not reveal contract contents externally. (Access to contract terms is controlled; if you believe you need access, follow the proper request procedure.)

Minimal Footprint Policy
When accessing remote resources, leave no unnecessary artifacts. Clean temporary files and logs created during maintenance or testing.

Third-Party Disclosure
Any third-party requests for company documents or access must be forwarded to Legal for approval before disclosure.

Acceptable Etiquette
Treat colleagues and company data with respect. Harassment, intimidation, or unauthorized sharing of private information will result in disciplinary action.

Compliance and Audits
All employees are subject to periodic audits. Cooperation with audit teams is mandatory.
